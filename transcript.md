### Hello

Hello to all. On the homepage of opensourcedesign it says "we interpret design at it's broadest sense". Inspired by that phrase, and, due to my involvement in both software and construction domains, I was thinking, what if we could expand the open source mentality to other design industries.

Armed with some informal research about the state of things today, I'm here to share some thoughts on how this could work, why it might fail and what might be required in order to induce change.


### Facilitators and Detractors

There are reasons that would actually make the open source culture easier to thrive on other design domains, and others that make it harder. I'm calling these facilitators and detractors.

Each design domain has it's own facilitators and detractors. I will mostly discuss construction design, and lightly touch product design as these are the areas I have some experience with. There will be time at the end for you to share your own experiences..


### History

1911: Henry Ford and the other car manufacturers agree to cross-license patents. This is one of the first documented attempts to share technology innovation accross an industry

1953: The System A-2 compiler is distributed to UNIVAC customers along with source. It is considered the first free and open-source piece of software, according to wikipedia. However the distribution was not due to activism or even a solid idea why software and knowledge should be public.

1950s: Software is like giving away the wrench and spare tire along with the car, a convenience for the buyer that costs little to the seller.

1970s: As software becomes more complicated, and dedicated software companies pop up, software becomes a product worth protecting.

1983: RMS publishes the GNU manifesto

1991: Linux

1993: Debian

I'm saying all this to underline that software people had caught a glimpse of the good thing and when it started to fade away some of them wanted the freedom back. This time though it''s ideological.


### Mythology

On the other hand, master builders and later architects and civil engineers never had the chance to see how their industry would work if information was shared freely.

It is interesting to note that this goes back a long time and mention two legends that show that the industry embraced copyright, long before copyright was a thing.

The tale of Hiram Abiff starts with his arrival in Jerusalem, and his appointment by Solomon as chief architect and master of works at the construction of his temple. As the temple is nearing completion, three fellowcraft masons from the workforce ambush him as he leaves the building, demanding the secrets of a master mason. Hiram is challenged by each in turn, and at each refusal to divulge the information his assailant strikes him with a mason's tool. He is injured by the first two assailants, and struck dead by the last.

The Rosslyn Chapel's "Apprentice Pillar" gets its name from a similar legend dating from the 18th century, involving the master mason in charge of the stonework in the chapel and his young apprentice mason. According to the legend, the master mason did not believe that the apprentice could perform the complicated task of carving the column without seeing the original which formed the inspiration for the design.

The master mason travelled to see the original himself, but upon his return was enraged to find that the upstart apprentice had completed the column by himself. In a fit of jealous anger, the master mason took his mallet and struck the apprentice on the head, killing him. The legend concludes that as punishment for his crime, the master mason's face was carved into the opposite corner to forever gaze upon his apprentice's pillar. 

Despite the fact that it is significantly simpler to reverse-engineer a building, the notion of keeping the source closed was prevalent for centuries.


### The Door is Ajar

The previous legends highlight the state of mind of construction designers, which is obviously a detractor. I've seen extreme behaviors that underline this reality. A construction executive wanted to upload really low resolution photos on their website, compromising it's advertising effectiveness, in order to protect construction details. An architect did provide their drawings to the engineers of the design team solely in pdf form.

However, mentality changes with time and fortunately there are some things that might just help.

One of the facilitators is that in most places the drawings of a constructed building are available to the public, by law. In some cases you need a legal interest such as "I'm interested in buying the building" or "I'm the neighbour and I'm worried it'll fall on my house" which are so vague, anybody hell-bent on obtaining the drawings will.

A second facilitator is that, at least for the architectural and structural domains, it's often easy to reverse-engineer the result.

The point is that there isn't very much to protect anyway. Compared to the benefits of having vast amounts of information easily accessible it is definitely outweighed. 


### No copies please!

Buildings usually can't be copied verbatim. 

Parameters like earthquake risk, regulations, plot size, building size contstraints, orientation and other factors make re-constructing a building from past designs impossible. Even in the case of tower blocks, soil parameters or minor design changes between towers warrant separate design documents. Thus there is no fear of diminishing work due to clients re-using old, open source designs.

Contrast this with software, where millions of people might use the exact same version without ever paying a dime.

Construction design work is always contracted. When it is time to decide if you are going to open source it, you have already been paid for it, and it's highly unlikely that you are going to profit by it anymore. Thus the actual cost and the cost of opportunity both approach zero.


### API's

Another facilitator is the eagerness of component manufacturers to provide with CAD drawings of their components in the same way that software component vendors provide examples and API references.


### Product

Product design is harder, as it involves trademarks. On one hand trademarks might be a way to prevent creating an identical product, but on the other, the design is an indivisible part of the product identity, and some times, such as the Coca-Cola bottle it is trademarked by itself.

Firefox might be a good example case. It is free software, however the trademarks prevent a forked project to damage it's reputation. It is possible that product designs could be approached in a similar way.


### Bye!

My conclusion is that introducing an open source workflow in construction design processes is not too hard from a technical point of view. The most significant detractors stem from history and human mentality. In product design reality is a little bit harder.

What in my opinion is needed is a GNU manifesto moment, a movement, a spark to start the process.

It is interesting to mention here that one of the most used contract templates in construction design states clearly that the copyright of the work belongs to the consultant, and that the client can only use and copy it exclusively for the Project and the purpose for which they are intended.

This leaves the decision of open sourcing the work squarely in the hands of the designer.

We still have a bit of time and I'd like your thoughts on this subject.

Keep in mind that I am not a lawyer nor an expert in licenses. This talk aims to just spark a discussion on how we could "preach" opensource to other industries that may have never heard of it, and which of those industries would be the most receptive. 

...

Thank you very much, and let's continue the discussion online.
